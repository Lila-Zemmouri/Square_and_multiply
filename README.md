# Square_and_multiply
In order to study the complexity and execution time of the power calculation, this program that will show the difference between the power calculation with the naive algorithm and the square and multiply algorithm. This program will first ask the user to give an integer value x (the base), and another which is the exponent. The program will use the same x for the rest.
